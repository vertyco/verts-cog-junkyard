# Vert's Cog Junkyard

![Artwork](https://i.imgur.com/8QGMhkj.png)
Various cogs live here, they have either been succeeded by their newer rewrite, don't work anymore, or are just no
longer being maintained.

### Cogs found here may or may not still work!

I am not providing support for these cogs anymore.
